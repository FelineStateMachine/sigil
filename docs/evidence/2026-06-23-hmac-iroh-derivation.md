## Question

Can a FIDO2 security key produce stable keying material (via hmac-secret) that can seed a working Iroh node identity?

## Result: PASS

### Observed output

=== Spike 004: PASS ===
Titan HMAC-Secret -> Iroh identity derivation: CONFIRMED
Same Titan + same PIN + same salt always produces EndpointId 5dff09ef28cdc7bfc04220645c1a775fef2a7fed3de54d665915c6f59dad1d9a
```

### How it works

1. **make_credential** with `Extension::HmacSecret(Some(true))` on RPID "keyhome" — registers a credential on the Titan that supports hmac-secret. Requires PIN + touch.
2. **get_assertion** with `Extension::HmacSecret(Some(salt))` where `salt = SHA-256("keyhome-iroh-identity-v1")` — the Titan computes `HMAC-SHA-256(CredRandom, salt)` and returns 32 bytes. Requires PIN + touch.
3. **SecretKey::from_bytes(&hmac_output)** — Iroh's Ed25519 SecretKey accepts exactly 32 bytes. The HMAC output is 32 bytes. Perfect fit.
4. **Endpoint::builder().secret_key(secret_key).bind()** — creates an Iroh endpoint with the derived identity.
5. **Ping** — a second endpoint (random identity) dials the derived-identity endpoint and pings it successfully.

### Key properties

- **Deterministic**: Same Titan + same PIN + same salt = same 32-byte HMAC = same Iroh EndpointId every time.
- **PIN-protected**: Both make_credential and get_assertion require the Titan PIN.
- **Touch-protected**: Both operations require physical touch on the key.
- **No stored secrets**: The Iroh identity is derived on-the-fly from the Titan. No key files to persist.
- **32-byte fit**: HMAC-SHA-256 output is exactly 32 bytes, matching Iroh's Ed25519 SecretKey size.
